# 📈 Intelligent Stock Predictor (Multivariate LSTM & GRU)

This project aims to forecast the closing prices of Brazilian stocks using multivariate time series processed by deep learning neural networks (LSTM and GRU). The model is trained individually for each asset using historical data obtained from *br.investing.com*. The application features graphical visualizations and an interactive Gradio interface.

## 🎯 Objective

Develop a modular and intelligent system that:
- Predicts the **next trading day's** closing price based on the past 60 days;
- Compares predictions with actual test data;
- Projects **future trends for 30 business days**;
- Supports interactive usage with CSV file upload via Gradio;
- Is easily auditable and updatable.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### 🔸 Multivariate LSTM & GRU
- **Input Features:**
  - `Closing Price`
  - `Return_%`
  - `MM9` (9-day moving average)
  - `RSI` (Relative Strength Index)
- **Prediction:** Closing price for the next business day
- **Model File:** `model_lstm_multivariado.keras` or `model_gru_multivariado.keras`

The architectures consist of **three sequential LSTM or GRU layers** with progressive Dropouts to avoid overfitting, followed by a final dense layer that outputs the predicted closing price.  
The network is optimized using the **Adam optimizer** with a reduced learning rate to ensure training stability.

## 🗂️ Data Source and Updates

- Data was manually obtained from: [Investing.com](https://br.investing.com/)
- ⚙️ **Future Update:** The project is being refactored to use automated data ingestion via APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Twelve Data, or official B3 API) for real-time and continuous data updates. For now, the manually downloaded Investing data is more than sufficient for robust model training and is kept up-to-date for all tests and demonstrations.
- **Note:** For clarity and reproducibility, only the PETR4 stock is showcased in this README. For other assets, please run the program or contact the author.

## 📊 Quantitative Results — LSTM vs GRU (PETR4)

Below we demonstrate the performance of both LSTM and GRU architectures using PETR4 as an example.

| Model   |  RMSE   |  MAE   |  MAPE (%) |   R²   |  MedAE  |  Directional_Acc (%) |
|:--------|--------:|-------:|----------:|-------:|--------:|---------------------:|
| **lstm**| 1.93    | 1.42   |    7.03   | 0.95   | 1.08    | 49.03               |
| **gru** | 1.30    | 0.91   |    4.28   | 0.98   | 0.69    | 51.53               |

> Metrics were calculated using the test set (20%) and saved in `results/metricas_modelos.csv`.

## 🌐 Web Application

The project uses **Gradio** to provide an interactive interface for:
- Uploading `.csv` files;
- Training with multiple assets;
- Viewing metrics and charts;
- Making predictions with updated data.

> 💡 Hosting planned for HuggingFace Spaces or Streamlit Cloud.
